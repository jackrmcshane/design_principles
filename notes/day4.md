## Lecture Notes/Thoughts

Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) -> consist of two opposing networks which benefit from hindering the performance of the other.
* used for generating data from a core set
* very sensitive to hyper parameter tweaking


* obviously expensive to run, how do I verify that the principle components used for generating new data / fooling the discriminator are those necessary for a classification task with multiple classes
* is it feasible to train a single GAN to generate multiple classes or would it be better to train a GAN on the individual classes 
* if I wanted to
